					<li>
						<strong>What does an architect do?</strong> <br />
						<span
							>Architects design and draw plans of buildings which
							are used in the construction industry. Architects
							also work on the restoration, conservation and
							renovation of existing buildings.</span
						>
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Why do I need an architect?</strong> <br />
						<span
							>Architects ensure that the work is professionally
							done and that it meets the requirements of Building
							Control. Architects help to make sure the building
							is well-designed and realistic. An architect can
							also help you find the best builder for your work
							and can manage the project whilst keeping within
							your budget.</span
						>
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>When should I hire an architect?</strong> <br />
						<span
							>It is best to hire an architect as soon as you are
							ready to begin designing your construction project.
							The earlier the better! We are happy to provide
							rough estimates for the cost of your project and can
							provide some preliminary designs at the start of the
							process.</span
